UI/Spatializer Interaction:
When a new person is added to conference:
	Initialize audio source with its initial position
		AudioSS person1 = new AudioSS(px, py);
			(px, pv) = added person’s coordinate
			ITD and volume determined based on (px, py)

When the person is moved within the space:
	Update the ITD and Volume based on new position
		person1.moveTo(nx, ny);
			(nx, ny) = new position
			ITD and volume determined based on new positions
